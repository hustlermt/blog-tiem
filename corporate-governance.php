                    Whilst TIEM is a private limited liability company with no statutory obligation for elaborate corporate governance
                        structures, such as King II prescriptions for public companies, the co-founding sponsors desire to adhere to best
                        practice corporate governance practices. This is intended to give all our key stakeholders, including potential 
                        clients and investors, utmost confidence in the brand.

                    While, currently, TIEM has two (2) directors – being the two (2) co-founding shareholding directors – the strategic
                        intent is to co-opt at least three (3) additional independent directors who shall be carefully head-hunted for 
                        their depth of industry specific expertise and experience as well as technical expertise in areas where existing 
                        executive director(s) are not very string in, so as to bring strategic balance in the skillset at board level. 
                        Overall, the Board shall provide strategic leadership and oversight to TIEM management, in line with good corporate
                        governance best practice.
